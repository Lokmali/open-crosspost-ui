# Progress: Open Crosspost

## Current Status

The Open Crosspost application is functional with core features implemented. We are now refactoring the authentication flow to centralize authorization checks in the layout component and simplify state management by leveraging the `@crosspost/sdk` directly.

## What Works

- **Authentication**: Users can connect with NEAR wallet
- **Platform Connections**: Users can connect multiple social media accounts
- **Post Editor**: Users can create and edit posts, including threads
- **Media Upload**: Users can attach media to posts
- **Cross-Platform Posting**: Posts can be sent to multiple platforms
- **Draft Management**: Users can save and load drafts
- **Basic Error Handling**: Simple success/failure notifications

## What Needs Improvement

### 1. Authentication Flow Refactor (Current Focus)

- **Issue**: Authentication logic is scattered and relies on a redundant Zustand store
- **Current Behavior**: Uses `near-auth-store.ts` to manage auth state separately from the SDK
- **Needed Improvements**:
  - ✅ Centralize auth checks in `_crosspost.tsx` layout component
  - ✅ Use `client.auth.isAuthenticated()` as the source of truth
  - ✅ Simplify `AuthModal` to use auth service directly
  - ✅ Implement global signal mechanism for auth invalidation
  - ✅ Remove redundant Zustand store
  - ✅ Clean up references to the old auth store

### 2. Error Handling System (Current Focus)

- **Issue**: The API returns a 200 status code but can contain platform-specific errors in the response body
- **Current Behavior**: Shows "post successfully to all platforms" even when some platforms fail
- **Needed Improvements**:
  - ✅ API has been updated with improved error response format
  - ✅ SDK has been enhanced with comprehensive error handling utilities
  - ✅ Removed custom error-handling.ts file in favor of SDK utilities
  - ⬜ Update UI to properly display different error states
  - ⬜ Create detailed error investigation UI
  - ⬜ Implement retry functionality for failed posts
  - ⬜ Test all error scenarios

### 3. Future Improvements (Backlog)

- **Post History**: View history of past posts and their status
- **Analytics**: Track posting performance across platforms
- **Scheduled Posts**: Schedule posts for future publishing
- **Post Templates**: Save and reuse post templates
- **Enhanced Media Handling**: Better media editing and optimization

## Known Issues

1. ~~**Authentication Flow**: Redundant state management and scattered auth logic~~ (Resolved)
2. **Error Display**: Misleading success messages when posts fail on specific platforms
3. **Platform-Specific Limitations**: No clear indication of platform-specific constraints
4. **Rate Limiting**: No specific handling for rate limiting errors

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Authentication Flow Refactor (Completed)

1. ✅ Update `_crosspost.tsx` to implement gatekeeping logic
2. ✅ Modify `AuthModal` to use auth service directly
3. ✅ Implement global signal mechanism for auth invalidation
4. ✅ Remove `near-auth-store.ts` and clean up references
5. ✅ Test all authentication scenarios

### Phase 2: Error Handling Improvements (Current)

1. ✅ Adopt SDK's error handling utilities
2. ✅ Remove custom error handling abstractions
3. ⬜ Update UI to properly display different error states
4. ⬜ Create detailed error investigation UI
5. ⬜ Implement retry functionality for recoverable errors
6. ⬜ Test all error scenarios

### Phase 3: User Experience Enhancements (Future)

1. Post history and status tracking
2. Platform-specific formatting guidance
3. Enhanced media management
4. Performance optimizations

## Metrics

- **Post Success Rate**: Currently tracking overall success but not platform-specific success
- **User Engagement**: Monitoring active users and posting frequency
- **Error Recovery**: Not currently tracked, will be implemented with new error handling
- **Authentication Success**: Will track success/failure rates with new auth flow
